          Planning a party starts with ideas. Who's coming, how it should feel,
          the kind of night you want to create. <br /><br />What's easy to
          underestimate is how much coordination it takes to bring it all
          together. The decisions, the messages, the timelines, the constant
          small questions. <br /><br />Before you know it, you're hosting <em
            >and</em
          > managing. And that's when it gets harder to stay present. <br /><br
          />You want your guests to feel taken care of. But you don't want to
          miss the moments you're hosting for.
